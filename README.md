The UR-OS simulator is a Java-based application that plans to include all the main active elements of a computer system, 
to replicate the behavior of an operating system and its relationship with hardware elements like the processor, memory, file system, etc. 
It presents a modular design that allows the selection of different combinations of algorithms for each function. 
The current version, 0.0.3.7, is focused on the process planning function.

This program is a Netbeans 20 project compailed with Java 17. The project does not include external libraries apart from the JSE SDK package. 

This simulator was created by Pedro Wightman, associate professor of the School of Engineering, Science and Technology at Universidad del Rosario, Bogota, Colombia.
